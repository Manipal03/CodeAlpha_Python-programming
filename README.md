## Description
This repository contains the Python programming tasks completed as part of my internship with CodeAlpha. Each task focuses on a different aspect of Python programming and showcases my skills and understanding of various concepts.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Hangman
In this task, I implemented the classic game of Hangman. Users can guess letters to uncover a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides a fun and interactive way to test vocabulary and guessing skills.

### Task 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker
For this task, I developed a stock portfolio tracker application. Users can add, remove, and monitor stocks in their portfolio. The application provides real-time stock data and allows users to analyze their investment performance.

### Task 3: Chat Bot
The Chat Bot task involved creating a simple conversational bot using Python. The bot is capable of responding to user input, answering queries, and engaging in basic conversation. It demonstrates my understanding of natural language processing and chatbot development.

## Installation

## Usage
Detailed usage instructions for each task can be found in their respective directories.
